# Project 1: System Analysis & Design- Chris Lynch Fencing

Challenge: Evaluate and improve outdated business processes for a family-owned fencing company operating across multiple Hawaiian Islands, where manual tracking of inventory and job estimates led to inefficiencies.

Context: The company was using spreadsheets and handwritten calculations to manage core operations, which often caused delays, inaccuracies, and limited scalability. A more efficient, modern solution was needed to support their growth and improve daily workflows.

Action: Using system analysis and design practices, I assessed the company's operational needs by interviewing staff, documenting current workflows, and identifying pain points. I researched software alternatives and evaluated them based on features, cost, and compatibility with the company’s goals. I ultimately recommended a cloud-based platform, FieldBin, to streamline inventory management and job estimating.

Results: The proposed solution addressed key inefficiencies by replacing manual methods with automated, centralized tools. The recommendation improved accuracy, reduced administrative burden, and laid the groundwork for scalable operations across all service locations.

Reflection: This project gave me hands-on experience in system analysis—understanding user needs, evaluating technical solutions, and aligning technology with business goals. It reinforced the value of thoughtful system design in solving real-world problems.
