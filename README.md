# Project 1: System Analysis & Design- Chris Lynch Fencing

Challenge: Design a system analysis application

Context: For the system analysis project, I created a web-based application that allowed users to track the progress of a system analysis project. The goal was to allow users to input and manage information related to the systemâ€™s requirements, analysis, design, and testing phases. I used a SQL Server database to store this information.

Action: I created models for tracking project phases, stakeholder details, project requirements, and analysis documents. The main focus was on linking requirements to their respective project phases and making sure the system could handle adding, editing, and deleting project elements. In the DbContext, I set up relationships between the models so that project requirements could be linked to the relevant phases and stakeholders.

Results: The hardest part was organizing the database relationships. Once I figured out how to link phases and requirements, everything worked smoothly.

Reflection: I gained valuable experience in database design and system analysis. It was fulfilling to see how the application could dynamically adjust as the project progressed, and it helped me understand the importance of good database architecture.
